Integrate Lucidel software into your wordpress website to automatically access web analytics insights. 

== Description ==

This plug-in allows users to very quickly incorporate Lucidel software into their Wordpress webpage. It automatically goes through your web pages and adds all the javascript tags that are necessary for you to start analyzing your web traffic. 

Lucidel software combines the power of google analytics with its own software and allows users to access demographic data of their website's visitors:   

* Age  
* Gender   
* Income Level  
* Educational Level
* Political Affiliation 
* High Level Geographic Segmentation 

in addition to the basic metrics that google analytics provides. More importantly, however, using Lucidel's automated algorithm, users will be notified of changes, trends, etc that occur over time allowing them to save time doing the analysis and jump right to the insights.

== Frequently asked questions ==


= Where do you get information about my visitors? = 
A) We buy it from the same sources that ad networks that target us based on our demographic information and surfing habits.

= Does that have a negative impact the privacy of my users? = 
A) Not really. Nothing is known about us personally, just that we fall into large 'buckets' like "middle aged man who likes cars". These data marketplaces still know less about us than the guys who send us junk mail. And they aren't annoying like them.

= What metrics do you look for? = 
A) We look at every standard metric out there plus a few KPIs we have created.

= Can I get more reports? = 
A) If there is information you want but aren't seeing send us an email (ideas@lucidel.com) and we will try and include it in a future version.

= Can i access the demographics information in my google analytics account? = 
A) Not at the moment. In order to be able to include as many dimension to our reports as possible we compress the data in a way that only our algorithms can understand. But we are working on it.

= Can I control what metrics I receive and how frequently I get them? = 
A) We are working on more personalization features. If you have any specific requests please send us an email (ideas@lucidel.com) and we will try and make it happen for you.
